# Automated Investment Property Research System with Multi-Agent AI

This project involved developing an **automated investment property research system** using the **CrewAI multi-agent framework**. The system orchestrates role-playing autonomous AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks, such as property research, data analysis, and decision-making. It integrates with a local Ollama model (`openhermes`) for enhanced privacy, customization, and performance.


## Highlights

### Multi-Agent System
- **Framework**: CrewAI, enabling coordination among autonomous agents for task-specific roles.
- **Roles**: Agents specialized in property research, data analysis, and decision-making to streamline the property investment process.

### Local Model Integration
- **Model**: Ollama's `openhermes` deployed locally.  
- **Advantages**:
  - Enhanced privacy by eliminating reliance on external APIs.
  - Customizability to fit specific project needs.
  - Potential performance gains due to reduced latency and localized control.


## Key Features
- **Task Automation**:
  - Fully automated property research workflow, reducing manual effort.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Agents collaborate seamlessly to handle interdependent tasks.


## Skills Demonstrated

- Proficiency in designing and implementing **multi-agent systems**.  
- Expertise in **AI orchestration** and task automation.  
- Experience in integrating **local AI models** for privacy-focused, real-world applications.
